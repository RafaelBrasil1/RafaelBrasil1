## 📖 Currently Learning

I am always trying to learn new things, specially when it comes to things I don't understand now. While I learn everything I can from my school, I also try to explore and get to know everything I can from external materials.
I am also trying to learn more and more about artificial intelligence and virtual reality, which are topics I can't wait to learn.
